This is a working/in progress Android application to allow users to 
look up alcoholic drink recipes on their phone, along with the ability
to enter their own ingredients and look up possible drinks with those
specifications.

Current features in the works:
 - ability to shake for random drink
 - implement SQLite database for quicker/more efficient data management
 - ability to enter in personal recipes for drinks
