Things to do:

Improved database - More drinks

Extras - 
    Favorites
    Shaking causes random drink (I think this would be cool, but I have no idea how the API works for this)
    Stored inventory (have a profile of some sort that saves the owned ingredients from session to session. Might just be writing out to drinks.in?)
