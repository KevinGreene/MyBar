Things to do:

Get a working drink page - Displaying ingredients and amounts instead of just flashing on the bottom

Inventory improvement - Being able to glance and see if you have already selected an ingredient in a prior session.

Improved database - I will hopefully put in some time this Thanksgiving weekend making a much more complete database from idrink.com, with ratings

Extras - 
    Favorites
    Shaking causes random drink (I think this would be cool, but I have no idea how the API works for this)
    Stored inventory (have a profile of some sort that saves the owned ingredients from session to session. Might just be writing out to drinks.in?)



Inventory updates don't cause any drinks to be removed

Random drink appears to always be Rum and Coke. While delicious, look into this problem.
